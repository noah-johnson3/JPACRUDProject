### Full-Stack CRUD Project SkillDistillery Week 9 Project

## Description
Hello! Welcome to my first solo full-stack application. This is based on a game called Path of Exile that I have played for almost 10 years. It is simulating creating a character from hard coded or user coded parameters. I include a gallery of some of the pictures for the options you will be selecting. It will pull data from the database and display it for you, you can then create, update, or delete a character from the database. I also included a short video from the games recent league launch on May 13th 2022. Enjoy!

## Lessons Learned
* How to Successfully create and manage a small 1 table database.
* How to create a fully functional and modular back end.
* How to create a front end that accepts user input, takes the data and manipulates it with the back end to then display on the page.
* How to manipulate the page with css and JSP. 
* CSS is much harder than originally guessed.

## Technologies Used
* Java
* Spring Boot
* Spring MVC
* MySQL Workbench
* MySQL JSP
* CSS
* HTML
* JPA
* Terminal

## How to use
When you first load up the page you will see the home screen. There will be a short video there, I encourage you to watch it. On the top of the page you will have a field to enter a character ID. I have hard coded 8 characters for you to display Character IDs: 1-8. I did NOT setup a fail page so you MUST enter a character if you hit "show character" without entering an ID the site will break. From there you you will have a link to go back to the home screen. If you choose to view the gallery which I highly recommend you will see some photos from the game. You can create a new character and enter all the fields I have provided, I hardcoded default values for all of these. There will be another home button there as well. Finally in the Show all Characters page it will display and update characters as you add them to the database. The edit character and delete character both us the same Character ID: field and this does work. Simply type the ID and choose either update or delete to do this. 

## Take aways
I had A LOT of fun creating my first full-stack application. HTML/CSS Is complpicated yet rewarding. I do not see myself as being a web designer but I was happy to dabble in it for the duration of this project.

Thank you!
